    "Merge sort is a recursive algorithm that continually splits a list in half. If the list is empty or has one item, it is sorted by definition (the base case). If the list has more than one item, we split the list and recursively invoke a merge sort on both halves. Once the two halves are sorted, the fundamental operation, called a merge, is performed. Merging is the process of taking two smaller sorted lists and combining them together into a single, sorted, new list.\n",

    "A __combiner__ is an optimization function which aggregates local data before sending it to the reducer. Hadoop makes no guarantees about utilizing this function, thus the correctness of the algorithm must not rely on it. One could use a combiner for doing a word count, where local word counts are calculated before being sent to the reducer. This improves perfomance by reducing network traffic, since there are fewer intermediate key/value pairs that need to be sent to the reducer. Ex) instead of two pairs (word,1) and (word,1), we can send one pair (word,2)\n",

    "The process of moving data from the mappers to the reducers is called __shuffling__. In this phase, Hadoop performs a groupBy operation using a hash function on the keys, placing Key/Value pairs with the same hash into the same reducer. Alternatively, the programer can specify a custom \"partition\" function which ensures that key/value parirs are sent to the same reducers based on some business logic."
