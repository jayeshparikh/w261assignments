# Additional Resources
Let us know if there are other outside materials that you've found helpful going through the course & we'll add them here for future students.   

Some of the notebooks in the various directories may be using older versions of Python or Spark - this is just the reality of technology. However, the concepts contained within them are still relevant, and you may still find them useful.
