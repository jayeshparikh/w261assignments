    "Designing MapReduce algorithms involves two kinds of planning. First we have to figure out which parts of a calculation can be performed in parallel and which can't. Then we have to figure out how to put those pieces together so that the right information ends up in the right place at the right time. That's what the Hadoop shuffle is all about. Today we'll talk about a few techniques to optimize your Hadoop jobs. By the end of this demo you should be able to:  \n",
    "* ... __identify__ what makes the Hadoop Shuffle potentially costly.\n",
    "* ... __define__ local aggregation & identify when it won't help.\n",
    "* ... __implement__ partial, unordered, and total order sort.\n",
    "* ... __create__ custom counters for your Hadoop Jobs.\n",
    "* ... __describe__ the order inversion pattern & when to use it (ie: relative frequencies).\n",

    "**Note**: Hadoop Streaming syntax is very particular. Make sure to test your python scripts before passing them to the Hadoop job and pay careful attention to the order in which Hadoop job parameters are specified."

    "# Exercise 2: Custom Partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week in Breakout 4 you learned out to implement a secondary sort -- that is, you learned how to tell Hadoop to order key-value pairs within each partition based on the value. However you also saw the limitation of this simple secondary sort: namely that sorting within a partition is not very useful if you need to use multiple reducers because, for example, the top word could end up in any one of the partitions and the next highest might end up in a totally different partition. Of course post processing your partially sorted partition files (eg. using mergesort) might solve this problem, but if your data is too large to fit on a single machine that is not a viable solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, Hadoop provides a way to partition the data across reducers in a user-defined way.  This is done telling Hadoop to use all or part of the composite key as a partitioning key. All lines with the same partition key are guaranteed to be processed by the same reducer. This is similar to the sort key, but allows for control at a higher level. This \"custom partitioning\" will both solve our sorting troubles from last week and solve the problem you saw when using multiple reducers in Exercise 1 this week. To use custom partitioning, there are 2 more parameters we need to add to our Hadoop Streaming Command:\n",
    "\n",
    " __`-D mapreduce.partition.keypartitioner.options=\"-k1,1\"`__: tells Hadoop that we want to use the first key field as a partition key. Note: just like the `keycomparator`, `keypartitioner` must be used in conjuction with `stream.num.map.output.key.fields`.\n",
    "\n",
    "__`-partitioner org.apache.hadoop.mapred.lib.KeyFieldBasedPartitioner`__: tells Hadoop that we want to partition the data in a custom way. Note about partitioner: this line **MUST** appear after all of the `-D` options or it will be ignored.\n",
    "\n",

    "### (+ intro to counters)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know how to use custom partition keys, let's use this techinique to fix the problem from part d in Exercise 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "First a brief digression... A common challenge when implementing custom partitioning at scale is load balancing: _how can we ensure that each reducer node is doing approximately the same amount of work?_ Hadoop's option to define custom counters can be a useful way to monitor this kind of detail. Just like the built in  counters that you learned about last week, custom counters are a slight departure from statelessness. Normally we wouldn't want to share a mutable variable across multiple nodes, however in this case the framework manages so that you can increment them from any node without causing a race condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use a custom counter you'll just write an appropriately formatted line to the standard error stream. For example the following line would increment a counter called 'counter-name' in group 'MyWordCounters' by 10:\n",
    " > `sys.stderr.write(\"reporter:counter:MyWordCounters,counter-name,10\\n\")`\n",
    " \n",
    "This line can be added to your mapper, combiner or reducer scripts and wraped in `if` clauses to increment only under certain conditions. If a counter with that name/group doesn't exsit yet the framework will create one. The values of your custom counters will be printed to the console in their respective groups just like the built in Job Tracking counters. Counters can only be incremented using integers (ie, floats are not supported).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, armed with this new tool let's return to the relative frequencies task.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Exercise 4: Unordered Total Sort vs Total Order Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "In HW1 we emphasized that sorting can be a useful preprocessing tool because sorted input can sometimes facilitate a more efficient algorithm design. However sorting is also often desirable in its own right. For example suppose you wanted to get the top and bottom 100 words according to their relative frequencies? The best way to get these results would be to do a Total Order Sort -- that is to sort the entire data set from highest to lowest so that you can simply read the first 100 records in the first partition and last 100 records in the last partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've tried two different ways of sorting using the Hadoop framework and neither quite achieved this result to satisfaction. First, in last week's breakout we performed a secondary sort using the `keycomparator` and accompanying Hadoop parameters. When we used a single reducer that strategy _did_ successfully result in a sort from top to bottom, but in a class all about scaling up for large data solutions that require a single reducer won't get us very far. Unfortunately when we tried using those same three sorting parameters and with multiple reducers we ended up with results sorted within each partition but not across partitions. This is what we call that a _partial sort_ because records are only ordered relative to the other keys that happen to be processed by the same reducer. Importantly a partial sort is of no use at all for us if we wanted to find the top 100 and bottom 100 from our relative frequencies file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in Exercise 2 of this notebook we learned how to specify a custom partition key so that we can explicitly control the partitioning. By combining the use of a custom partition key and the secondary sort from last week we were able to ensure that our results were not only sorted within their paritions but also that the paritioning grouped records with similar value ranges together. In theory this should have solved our 'total sort with multiple reducers' challenge but in practice something odd happened: the records with the top value didn't reliably end up in the first partition nor did the records with the lowest values necessarily end up in the last. The partition files themselves were out of order, making this an _unordered total sort_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason that the partitions appear out of order has to do with the hash function that Hadoop applies to your custom partition keys. That hash function results in an ordering that may not match the human readible string or integer numbering you as a programmer might have intended. Luckily, this hash function is both fixed and known -- so for example, if you are using partition keys `A`, `B`, and `C` your partitions will always end up ordered `B` - `C` -`A` (as you saw in Exercise 2). That means if we know in advance how many partitions (i.e. reducers) we plan to use, we can reverse engineer the hash function to figure out how Hadoop will order those keys and plan accordingly (for example in our 3 partition case by specifying that the top values should get the partition key `B` not `A`). When your data is sorted not only within each partition but the partitions are also in the right order, you've achieved a _total order sort_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's give it a try! Your job in this exercise is to write a Hadoop Job that will perform a total order sort on the output of Exercise 1 (relative frequencies) with any number of partitions.\n",
    "\n",
