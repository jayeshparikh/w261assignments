    "Designing MapReduce algorithms involves two kinds of planning. First we have to figure out which parts of a calculation can be performed in parallel and which can't. Then we have to figure out how to put those pieces together so that the right information ends up in the right place at the right time. That's what the Hadoop shuffle is all about. Today we'll talk about a few techniques to optimize your Hadoop jobs. By the end of this demo you should be able to:  \n",

    "* What work does your Hadoop cluster have to do at the shuffle stage? What determines the time complexity of this work?\n",
    "> Short digression: there is something slightly deceptive about this kind of MapReduce diagram -- the arrows make it look like data is flowing from step to step down the chart. Of course that is not the case physically. The shuffle stage is where the data gets moved. It doesn't linearly follow the 'paritioning' but includes all the work done by the framework after the mapper emits the data and before the reducers start. The work involved is costly in two ways: first in order to perform the sort Hadoop has to look at which keys are present on each data node & make a bunch of comparisions to sort these keys and plan where records with those keys are going to end up, then the data has to be transfered. The complexity is a function of the number of records output by our mappers (NOTE: this is different than the number of records we started with.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compare the Lyn & Dyer diagram with the om White diagram. How might the Lyn & Dyer diagram be misleading?\n",
    "> In the Lyn & Dyer diagram combiners appear to only be executed at the map phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is a combiner, how does it impact the shuffle? 'where' does the combining happen?\n",
    "> A combiner is an aggregation script specfied by the programmer that will take mapper output records with the same key and turn them into a single, combined, record. Usually this is desireable because fewer records = a faster shuffle. However its important to note that Hadoop uses the combiners strategically -- sometimes records are combined before leaving the mapper node, sometimes after arriving at a reducer node (this is related to the 'circular buffer' that you may remember discussed in the async). There are two key takeaways here 1) that Hadoop doesn't guarantee that it will perform the combining on any or all records and 2) Hadoop makes smart choice about when to hold data in memory/combine/spill to disk... saving a lot of work for the programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is local aggregation? Is a combiner the only way to do it?\n",
    "> Local aggregation is basically what we described a minute ago: reducing the number of records that need to be transfered over the network in the shuffle state _OR_ between two sequential MapReduce jobs. Combiners are _NOT_ the only way to perform local aggregation, we could also use an in memory form of aggregation eg. a python dicitonary. Of course there are risks to this approach if your mappers are emitting more records than the ones they read in. (_NOTE:_ local aggregation is one example of the 2nd technique that Lin & Dyer list: \"preserving state across multiple keys\").\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is a partitioner and how does it impact the shuffle? How/where can we specify custom partitioning behavior? If we don't specify a partitioner, will Hadoop still partition the data? How?\n",
    "> The 'partitioner' parameter in our Hadoop jobs (we saw this last week in live session) simply tells Hadoop how to determine which keys end up together on the same reducer node. Custom paritioning is just a matter of manipulating the key format/data structure -- this would happen in a  mapper script there is no 'paritioner' script. Anytime the programmer specifies more than one reducer then Hadoop will perform partitioning... if we don't tell it how to partittion explicitly then Hadoop will make its own decision about how to split up the key space.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can you think of an example of a task that can't be accomplished in a single MapReduce job? Explain.\n",
    "> Students should be able to come up with sorted word count --> can't sort until after reducing so you need a second job. We'll look at an example below of calculating relative frequencies... it would be good to guide them to consider the key challenge in that task: you can't divide until you have a total but what if you don't want to hold all of the counts in memory?

At first glance, computing relative frequencies (`word count / total count`) seems like it would be just as easy to implement -- after all it's just word count with an extra division at the end.

    "* Talk through what the MapReduce job would look like? What is the challenge here?  \n",
    "> The map would work the same as in word count, then the reducer would aggregate counts and also add up a total word count so that it can divide each word's count by the total. The challenge is that we won't know the total until after reducing. In word count we count in parallel and then add at the end. To compute frequencies we can still count in parallel but then we need to add both individual words and the total number of words before we can divide. \n",

    "# Exercise 2: Custom Partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week in Breakout 4 you learned out to implement a secondary sort -- that is, you learned how to tell Hadoop to order key-value pairs within each partition based on the value. However you also saw the limitation of this simple secondary sort: namely that sorting within a partition is not very useful if you need to use multiple reducers because, for example, the top word could end up in any one of the partitions and the next highest might end up in a totally different partition. Of course post processing your partially sorted partition files (eg. using mergesort) might solve this problem, but if your data is too large to fit on a single machine that is not a viable solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, Hadoop provides a way to partition the data across reducers in a user-defined way.  This is done telling Hadoop to use all or part of the composite key as a partitioning key. All lines with the same partition key are guaranteed to be processed by the same reducer. This is similar to the sort key, but allows for control at a higher level. This \"custom partitioning\" will both solve our sorting troubles from last week and solve the problem you saw when using multiple reducers in Exercise 1 this week. To use custom partitioning, there are 2 more parameters we need to add to our Hadoop Streaming Command:\n",
    "\n",
    " __`-D mapreduce.partition.keypartitioner.options=\"-k1,1\"`__: tells Hadoop that we want to use the first key field as a partition key. Note: just like the `keycomparator`, `keypartitioner` must be used in conjuction with `stream.num.map.output.key.fields`.\n",
    "\n",
    "__`-partitioner org.apache.hadoop.mapred.lib.KeyFieldBasedPartitioner`__: tells Hadoop that we want to partition the data in a custom way. Note about partitioner: this line **MUST** appear after all of the `-D` options or it will be ignored.\n",

    "> We created a composite key in Breakout 4 -- that was when we told Hadoop to treat the first two fields together as the key. We did this above for sorting purposes. Another way to create a composite key would have been to simply make a string joinin the two fields with a comma or dash (anything other than the Hadoop field delimiter).\n",

    "> Normally Hadoop's only guarantee is that records with the same key get processed on the same reducer node. However, if we wanted to process multiple keys together on a given reducer, we could use a partition key which determines which reducer note handles a record... but still allows us to sort on something more granular (eg. another field)."

Hadoop uses a hash function to assign our human readible partition keys to an ordered list of partitions. The ordering that is logical to us, may or may not get preserved in the process. However, its worth noting that this hash function is consistent. i.e. we just say Hadoop order B-C-A, that means it will always order those three keys that way. We can take advantage of this fact to perform a Total Order Sort -- i.e. a sort with multiple paritions that doestn' require any post-processing.

This is a lot less work than the merge-sort we needed for postprocessing our secondary sort in break out 4... but with a really large corpus this could still be in-ideal because it requires checking and comparing each partition.\n",

    "### (+ intro to counters)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know how to use custom partition keys, let's use this techinique to fix the problem from part d in Exercise 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "First a brief digression... A common challenge when implementing custom partitioning at scale is load balancing: _how can we ensure that each reducer node is doing approximately the same amount of work?_ Hadoop's option to define custom counters can be a useful way to monitor this kind of detail. Just like the built in  counters that you learned about last week, custom counters are a slight departure from statelessness. Normally we wouldn't want to share a mutable variable across multiple nodes, however in this case the framework manages so that you can increment them from any node without causing a race condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use a custom counter you'll just write an appropriately formatted line to the standard error stream. For example the following line would increment a counter called 'counter-name' in group 'MyWordCounters' by 10:\n",
    " > `sys.stderr.write(\"reporter:counter:MyWordCounters,counter-name,10\\n\")`\n",
    " \n",
    "This line can be added to your mapper, combiner or reducer scripts and wraped in `if` clauses to increment only under certain conditions. If a counter with that name/group doesn't exsit yet the framework will create one. The values of your custom counters will be printed to the console in their respective groups just like the built in Job Tracking counters. Counters can only be incremented using integers (ie, floats are not supported).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, armed with this new tool let's return to the relative frequencies task.\n",
    "\n",
    "__DISCUSSION:__\n",
    "> * Remember the problem we encountered at the end of Exercise 1? How would a custom partition key help us make sure the total counts get sent to each reducer node?\n",
    "* What does this do to the number of records being shuffled?\n",

    "* __a) add a custom partitioner:__  In __`MultiPart/mapper.py`__, __`MultiPart/combiner.py`__, and __`MultiPart/reducer.py`__ we've copied the base code from the frequencies job. Complete the code in this mapper so that it adds a custom partition key to each record and emits the total subcounts _once for each partition_. Assume we'll be using 4 partitions. Then make any required adjustments to your reducer and combiner to accomodate the new record format (your final output should not include the partition key, though you may want it there initially for debugging purposes).\n",

However since you've added a custom partition key to each record, the order inversion trick of adding a special character isn't going to work with Hadoop's default sorting behavior any more. Why not? What will you need to specify in your Hadoop job to make sure that the totals still arrive first?\n",

    "* __c) unit test & run your job:__ Write a few unit tests to debug your scripts. When you have them working as expected run the Hadoop job. [__`NOTE`__ We've provided a few tests to get you started but you'll need to add a unix sort to mimic the sorting you discussed in part 'b'].\n",

    "> We'd need to partition based on the relative frequencies but that is a challenge because the numbers are very very small and we're going to run into floating point errors. Another challenge is that this is going to be a inverse power law distribution --- lots of words which occur very few times & whose relative frequencies are clustered around 0.

    "# Exercise 4: Unordered Total Sort vs Total Order Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "In HW1 we emphasized that sorting can be a useful preprocessing tool because sorted input can sometimes facilitate a more efficient algorithm design. However sorting is also often desirable in its own right. For example suppose you wanted to get the top and bottom 100 words according to their relative frequencies? The best way to get these results would be to do a Total Order Sort -- that is to sort the entire data set from highest to lowest so that you can simply read the first 100 records in the first partition and last 100 records in the last partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've tried two different ways of sorting using the Hadoop framework and neither quite achieved this result to satisfaction. First, in last week's breakout we performed a secondary sort using the `keycomparator` and accompanying Hadoop parameters. When we used a single reducer that strategy _did_ successfully result in a sort from top to bottom, but in a class all about scaling up for large data solutions that require a single reducer won't get us very far. Unfortunately when we tried using those same three sorting parameters and with multiple reducers we ended up with results sorted within each partition but not across partitions. This is what we call that a _partial sort_ because records are only ordered relative to the other keys that happen to be processed by the same reducer. Importantly a partial sort is of no use at all for us if we wanted to find the top 100 and bottom 100 from our relative frequencies file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in Exercise 2 of this notebook we learned how to specify a custom partition key so that we can explicitly control the partitioning. By combining the use of a custom partition key and the secondary sort from last week we were able to ensure that our results were not only sorted within their paritions but also that the paritioning grouped records with similar value ranges together. In theory this should have solved our 'total sort with multiple reducers' challenge but in practice something odd happened: the records with the top value didn't reliably end up in the first partition nor did the records with the lowest values necessarily end up in the last. The partition files themselves were out of order, making this an _unordered total sort_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason that the partitions appear out of order has to do with the hash function that Hadoop applies to your custom partition keys. That hash function results in an ordering that may not match the human readible string or integer numbering you as a programmer might have intended. Luckily, this hash function is both fixed and known -- so for example, if you are using partition keys `A`, `B`, and `C` your partitions will always end up ordered `B` - `C` -`A` (as you saw in Exercise 2). That means if we know in advance how many partitions (i.e. reducers) we plan to use, we can reverse engineer the hash function to figure out how Hadoop will order those keys and plan accordingly (for example in our 3 partition case by specifying that the top values should get the partition key `B` not `A`). When your data is sorted not only within each partition but the partitions are also in the right order, you've achieved a _total order sort_. \n",

    "* __a) discuss:__ In the `%%writefile` cell below we create a partition file (__`partitions.txt`__) which contains the cut points we'll use to partition the data. Based on your reading of this file, how many partitions will we use? Think about the kinds of values that we got in Exercise 1 ... can you see any potential problems with these cutpoints?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) discuss:__ Read through __`TotalOrderSort/mapper.py`__ and __`TotalOrderSort/reducer.py`__. Which of these scripts makes use of our partition file? What does the mapper do? What does the reducer do? \n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code:__ Run the provided code below to apply this mapper and reducer. Note how the Hadoop job reads directly from the output directory we created in Exercise 1 (you will need to be those results were computed inorder to run this job). Use the provided code to view the output and confirm that the current implementation performs an unordered sort. What adjustments might you want to make to the partition file? (go ahead and modify it as desired). Then modify the Hadoop job so that it uses `/bin/cat` instead of `reducer.py`... and re-run the job this will allow you to see the order in which the partition keys were sorted. \n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) discuss:__ Read through __`TotalOrderSort/TOS_mapper.py`__. Pay particular attention to the helper function `makeKeyHash()` -- what does this function do? how is it used? how is this mapper different that the original one? \n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) code + discussion:__ Replace the original mapper with this new mapper(_don't forget to add it to the `-files` line_) and rerun the job (still with `/bin/cat` as reducer). How did the parition ordering change? What happpens if you change the partition file so that it has one extra number? Does your job work? Re-place the true reducer. Et voila, you have achieved total order sort!"

We can fix this by performing EDA on the input file and determining a way to balance the load across all 5 reducers. In this case we might use cutpoints more like: 0.5,0.3,0.2,0.1,0.\n",
