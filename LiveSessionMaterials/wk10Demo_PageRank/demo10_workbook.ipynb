    "__Identifying Special Nodes__ (Centrality): There are many ways to define what 'special' means, including metrics based on node in-degree, average distance to other nodes, and relationship to cluster structure. These special nodes are important to investigators attempting to break up terrorist cells, epidemiologists modeling the spread of diseases, advertisers trying to promote products, and many others. In particular, eigenvector centrality is used to find popular webpages using the PageRank algorithm, which in turn has been extended to Text summarization, Keyword extraction/Concept extraction using TextRank.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A few examples of graph centrality measures\n",
    "\n",
    "__Notation:__\n",
    "The neighborhood of a vertex $v$ in graph $G$ is defined as a set of neighbors of a vertex $v$ and is denoted by $N(v)$. The neighborhood size is the number of immediate neighbors to a vertex. \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of edges between all neighbors of a vertex is denoted by $E(v)$. In the directed graph, the set of $N_{in}(v)$ is the set of vertices that point to a vertex $v$ (predecessors) and set of $N_{out}(v)$ is the set of vertices that vertex $v$ points to (successors).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clustering coefficient\n",
    "The clustering coefficient of a vertex measures the density of edges among the immediate neighbors of a vertex. It determines the probability of the presence of an edge between any two neighbors of a vertex. It is calculated as a ratio between the number of edges $E_i$ that actually exist among these and the total possible number of edges among neighbors: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c(v) = \\frac{2E(v)}{|N(v)|(|N(v)|-1)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Degree Centrality\n",
    "The degree $d(v)$ of a vertex ùë£ is the number of edges at $v$; it is equal to the number of neighbors of $v$. The degree centrality $C_d(v)$ of a vertex $v$ is defined as the degree of the vertex. It can be normalized by dividing it by the maximum possible degree $N - 1$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C_d(v) = \\frac{d(v)}{N-1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Betweenness centrality \n",
    "The betweenness centrality $C_b(v)$ of a vertex $v$ quantifies the number of times a vertex acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other vertices. Let $\\sigma_{out}$ be the number of the shortest paths from vertex $u$ to vertex $t$ and let $\\sigma_{out}(v)$ be the number of those paths that pass through the vertex $v$. The normalized betweenness centrality of a vertex $v$ should be divided by the number of all possible edges in the graph and is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C_b(v) = \\frac{2\\sum_{v\\ne u\\ne t}\\frac{\\sigma_{ut}(v)}{\\sigma_{ut}}}{(N-1)(N-2)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Closeness centrality \n",
    "In a connected graph, closeness centrality (or closeness) of a node is a measure of centrality in a network, calculated as the reciprocal of the sum of the length of the shortest paths between the node and all other nodes in the graph. Thus, the more central a node is, the closer it is to all other nodes. When speaking of closeness centrality, people usually refer to its normalized form which represents the average length of the shortest paths instead of their sum. It is generally given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C_{closeness}(v) = \\frac{|V|}{\\sum_u d(u,v)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in the graph, and $d(u,v)$ is the distance between vertices $v$ and $u$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Eigenvector centrality   \n",
    "The eigenvector centrality $C_{EV}(v)$ measures the centrality of a vertex $v$ as a function of the centralities of its neighbors. For the vertex $v$ and constant $\\lambda$ it is defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C_{EV}(v) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\sum_{u\\in N(v)} C_{EV}(u)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of weighted networks, the equation can be generalized. Let $w_{uv}$ be the weight of edge between vertices $u$ and $v$ and $\\lambda$ a constant. The eigenvector centrality of a vertex $v$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C_{EV}(v) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\sum_{u\\in N(v)} w_{uv} \\times C_E(u)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The PageRank centrality is based on the eigenvector centrality measure and implements the concept of \"voting\". The PageRank score of a vertex $v$ is initialized to a default value and computed iteratively until convergence using the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C_{pagerank}(v) = (1-d) + d \\sum_{u \\in N_{in}(v)} \\frac {C_{PageRank}(u)}{|N_{out}(u)|}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "Plato speculated that after an uncountable number of years, the universe will reach an ideal state, returning to its perfect form. But it wasn't until the 16th century that Bernoulli came along and refined the idea of expectation. He was focused on a method of accurately estimating the unknown probability of some event based on the number of times the event occurs in independent trials.\n",
    "(pebbles in cups example). He went on to conclude \"If observations of all events be continued for the entire infinity, it will be noticed that everything in the world is governed by precise ratios and a constant law of change.\" This became known as the weak __law of large numbers__.  This idea was quickly extended as it was noticed that not only did things converge on an expected average, but the probability of variation away from averages also follow a familiar, underlying shape, or distribution. This overall curvature, known as the binomial distribution, appears to be an ideal form as it kept appearing everywhere any time you looked at the variation of a large number of random trials (coin toss example). It seems the average fate of these events is somehow predetermined, known today as the __central limit theorem__.\n",

    "Nekrasov didn't like the idea of a predetermined statistical fate, and claimed that __Independence__ is a neccessary condition for the law of large numbers. Since independence just describes these toy examples using beans or dice, where the outcome of previous events doesn't change the probability of the current or future events. However, as we all can relate, most things in the physical world are clearly dependent on prior outcomes, such as the chance of fire or sun or even our life expectancy. When the probability of some event depends, or is conditional, on previous events, we say they are dependent events, or dependent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This claim angered another Russian mathematician, Andrey Markov, who maintained a very public animosity towards Nekrasov. He goes on to say in a letter that \"this circumstance prompts me to explain in a series of articles that the law of large numbers can apply to dependent variables\", using a construction which he brags Nekrasov cannot even dream about! \n",
