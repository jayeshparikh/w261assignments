# MAGIC %md # Question 1: Distributed Graph Processing
# MAGIC Chapter 5 from Lin & Dyer gave you a high level introduction to graph algorithms and concernts that come up when trying to perform distributed computations over them. The questions below are designed to make sure you captured the key points from this reading and your async lectures. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q1 Tasks:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ Give an example of a dataset that would be appropriate to represent as a graph. What are the nodes/edges in this dataset? Is the graph you describe 'directed' or 'undirected'? What would the average "in-degree" of a node mean in the context of your example? 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ Other than their size/scale, what makes graphs uniquely challenging to work with in the map-reduce paradigm? *(__HINT__: Do not respond in terms of any specific algorithm. Think in terms of the nature of the graph datastructure itself).*
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ Briefly describe Dijskra's algorithm (goal/approach). What specific design component makes this approach hard to parallelize?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) short response:__ How does parallel breadth-first-search get around the problem that you identified in part `c`? At what expense?

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ### Q1 Student Answers:
# MAGIC > __a)__ Social Networking site is an example of dataset what can be represented as a graph. Friends and Family members would represent as nodes and relationships would represent as edges. This graph would be described as 'undirected'. The degree of a node is simply the summation of all the edges linked to it. The average degree is summation of all nodesâ€™ degree divided by the total number of nodes. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ It is not possible to communicate global state from node to node within map-reduce framework as well as maintain the global data structures in memory
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __c)__ Dijskra's algorithm maintains a global priority queue of nodes with priorities equal to their distance from the source node. At each iteration, the algorithm expands the node with the shortest distance & updates distance to all reachable nodes. The key to Dijskra's algorithm is that it maintains a global priority queue which makes it hard to parallelize.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __d)__ Parallel breadth-first-search is an iterative algorithm where each iteration corresponds to a map-reduce job. The algorithm works by mapping over all the nodes and emitting a key-value pair for each neighbor on  the node's adjacency list. Parallel breadth-first-search requires multiple iterations to traverse through all the nodes

# MAGIC %md # Question 2: Representing Graphs 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In class you saw examples of adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations of graphs. These data structures were probably familiar from HW3, though we hadn't before talked about them in the context of graphs. In this question we'll discuss some of the tradeoffs associated with these representations. __`NOTE:`__ We'll use the graph from Figure 5.1 in Lin & Dyer as a toy example. For convenience in the code below we'll label the nodes `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and `E` instead of $n_1$, $n_2$, etc but otherwise you should be able to follow along & check our answers against those in the text.

# MAGIC %md # Question 3: Markov Chains and Random Walks
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC As you know from your readings and in class discussions, the PageRank algorithm takes advantage of the machinery of Markov Chains to compute the relative importance of a webpage using the hyperlink structure of the web (we'll refer to this as the 'web-graph'). A Markov Chain is a discrete-time stochastic process. The stochastic matrix has a principal left eigen vector corresponding to its largest eigen value which is one. A Markov chain's probability distribution over its states may be viewed as a probability vector. This steady state probability for a state is the PageRank of the corresponding webpage. In this question we'll briefly discuss a few concepts that are key to understanding the math behind PageRank. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q3 Tasks:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ It is common to explain PageRank using the analogy of a web surfer who clicks on links at random ad infinitum. In the context of this hypothetical infinite random walk, what does the PageRank metric measure/represent?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ What is the "Markov Property" and what does it mean in the context of PageRank?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ A Markov chain consists of $n$ states plus an $n\times n$ transition probability matrix. In the context of PageRank & a random walk over the WebGraph what are the $n$ states? what implications does this have about the size of the transition matrix?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) code + short response:__ What is a "right stochastic matrix"? Fill in the code below to compute the transition matrix for the toy graph from question 2. [__`HINT:`__ _It should be right stochastic. Using numpy this calculation can be done in one line of code._]
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __e) code + short response:__ To compute the stable state distribution (i.e. PageRank) of a "nice" graph we can apply the power iteration method - repeatedly multiplying the transition matrix by itself, until the values no longer change. Apply this strategy to your transition matrix from `part d` to find the PageRank for each of the pages in your toy graph. Your code should print the results of each iteration. How many iterations does it take to converge? Which node is most 'central' (i.e. highest ranked)? Does this match your intuition? 
# MAGIC     * __`NOTE 1:`__ _this is a naive approach, we'll unpack what it means to be "nice" in the next question_.
# MAGIC     * __`NOTE 2:`__ _no need to implement a stopping criteria, visual inspection should suffice_.

# MAGIC %md # Question 7 - PageRank part 1 (Initialize the Graph)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC One of the challenges of performing distributed graph computation is that you must pass the entire graph structure through each iteration of your algorithm. As usual, we seek to design our computation so that as much work as possible can be done using the contents of a single record. In the case of PageRank, we'll need each record to include a node, its list of neighbors and its (current) rank. In this question you'll initialize the graph by creating a record for each dangling node and by setting the initial rank to 1/N for all nodes. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __`NOTE:`__ Your solution should _not_ hard code **N**.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q7 Tasks:
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ What is **N**? Use the analogy of the infinite random web-surfer to explain why we'll initialize each node's rank to 1/N. (i.e. what is the probabilistic interpretation of this choice?)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ Will it be more efficient to compute **N** before initializing records for each dangling node or after? Explain your reasoning.

# MAGIC %md # Question 8 - PageRank part 2 (Iterate until convergence)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Finally we're ready to compute the page rank. In this last question you'll write a Spark job that iterates over the initialized graph updating each nodes score until it reaches a convergence threshold. The diagram below gives a visual overview of the process using a 5 node toy graph. Pay particular attention to what happens to the dangling mass at each iteration.

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __`A Note about Notation:`__ The formula above describes how to compute the updated page rank for a node in the graph. The $P$ on the left hand side of the equation is the new score, and the $P$ on the right hand side of the equation represents the accumulated mass that was re-distributed from all of that node's in-links. Finally, $|G|$ is the number of nodes in the graph (which we've elsewhere refered to as $N$).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q8 Tasks:
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ In terms of the infinite random walk analogy, interpret the meaning of the first term in the PageRank calculation: $\alpha * \frac{1}{|G|}$
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ In the equation for the PageRank calculation above what does $m$ represent and why do we divide it by $|G|$?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ Keeping track of the total probability mass after each update is a good way to confirm that your algorithm is on track. How much should the total mass be after each iteration?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) code:__ Fill in the missing code below to create a Spark job that take the initialized graph as its input then iterates over the graph and for each pass:
# MAGIC   * reads in each record and redistributes the node's current score to each of its neighbors
# MAGIC   * uses an accumulator to add up the dangling node mass and redistribute it among all the nodes. (_Don't forget to reset this accumulator after each iteration!_)
# MAGIC   * uses an accumulator to keep track of the total mass being redistributed.( _This is just for your own check, its not part of the PageRank calculation. Don't forget to reset this accumulator after each iteration._)
# MAGIC   * aggregates these partial scores for each node
# MAGIC   * applies telportation and damping factors as described in the formula above.
# MAGIC   * combine all of the above to compute the PageRank as described by the formula above.
# MAGIC   * 
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC    __WARNING:__ Some pages contain multiple hyperlinks to the same destination, please take this into account when redistributing the mass.
